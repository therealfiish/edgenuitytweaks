### STILL A WIP, but works enough to get through courses.

# EdgenuityTweaks V2
### Originally created by @de-y, modified by me.

I was saddened to see (like many others) that Edgenuity had taken action and modified their website to make this script ineffective.
However, with some modifications, the script is now working once again!

## Installation:
1. Download the edgenuitytweaks.js file.
2. Go to Tampermonkey -> Dashboard -> Utilties -> click on the button next to "import file" -> click the .js file -> install!

## More Info:
- I might update the UI of this later, but as of right now I don't have any fixes to implement.
