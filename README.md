### STILL A WIP, but works enough. 

# EdgenuityTweaks V2
### Originally created by @de-y, modified by me.

After using this script for the longest time, I was saddenned to see (like many others) that Edgenuity had taken action and modified their website to make this script ineffective. 

However, with some modifications, the script is now working once again!

## Installation:
1. Download the edgenuitytweaks.js file.
2. Go to Tampermonkey -> Dashboard -> Utilties -> click on the button next to "import file" -> click the .js file -> install!
NOTE: **AUTO UPDATE DOESN'T WORK AS OF NOW! CHECK THIS GITHUB PERIODICALLY FOR NEW UPDATES**
